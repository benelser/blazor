# Components and Pages
This folder holds a component called [Person.razor](./Person.razor) that is consumed in page called [Family.razor](./Family.razor)

What is nice is we can see The Family page gets to not only use the Person class for its "componentness" for rendering markup, but also all of its methods etc just as we expect with our .net libs.
